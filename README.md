# Map of favourite city - Bhubaneswar

### frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map project


## About the project
---
* This is a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I like to visit.

* This is an assignment given by Udacity, with an aim to teach how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. Apart fro, this, we explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for us to use. We have implemented third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that improve the quality of this application.

## Instructions (mandatory)
---
* Download the files to the local system.
* Open the api_config.js file in the code editor. You have to enter your own Google API key to access the map. Therefore, in the code editor, we have to change the value of myAPIkey from "XXX" to the your API key. Within the double quotes, place your API key and save it.
* Open the index.html file in the browser.

## Features
---
* Use of knockout.js
* Google Maps API
* Wikipedia API

Using Wikipedia API, we have generated wikipedia URLs related to the place. In the info window of a place, when we click the link - 'Click for more info', we get directed to the page containing the information about the location.

By using knockout.js, we have implemented the search feature. On typing an alphabet in the search box in side bar, gives us the list of the available places starting with the same alphabet.

On clicking on a place in the list, activates the info window on the marker of that place.
